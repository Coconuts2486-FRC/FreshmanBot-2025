This directory contains the PhotonVision calibration files that are in use on
the Orange Pi's.  They are listed by camera name, which is shown on the label
on the back of each camera and in PhotonVision.  In case one of the Orange
Pi's goes belly up, this directory contains the calibrations for quick transfer
to the replacement device.
